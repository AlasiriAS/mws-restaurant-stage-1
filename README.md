# Front-End Web Developer - Project 7 - Restaurant Reviews
---
This project is part of Front-End Web Developer frnanodegree program by Udacity.

## what I did in the project 
 I convert a stattic webpage to a mobile-ready web application. I took a static design that lacks accessibility and convert it to be responsive on different sized displays, and accessibale for screen reader use. I also added a service worker that helps to create a seamless offline experience.

### Specification

I have been provided the code for a restaurant reviews website. The code has a lot of issues. It’s barely usable on a desktop browser, much less a mobile device. It also doesn’t include any standard accessibility features, and it doesn’t work offline at all. My job was to update the code to resolve these issues while still maintaining the included functionality.

### Project Rubric

my project will be evaluated by a Udacity code reviewer according to the [Restaurant Reviews project rubric](https://review.udacity.com/#!/rubrics/1090/view). Please review for detailed project requirements. The rubric should be a resource you refer to periodically to make sure your project meets specifications.

### Prerequisites

- You have to have a copy of the project.
- A python installed in your device (to run a server)
- a browser to run the project on your local mechine 

### How to run the project

- Clone/download a copy of the project
- in your diractory run CMD/terminal.
- type `python -V` . if it python 2.x you have to type `python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000`
if version of python is 3.x, type `python3 -m http.server 8000` or `python -m http.server 8000` in Windows.
- now with the server running, you can visit the site locally: `http://localhost:8000`

## Leaflet.js and Mapbox:

This repository uses [leafletjs](https://leafletjs.com/) with [Mapbox](https://www.mapbox.com/). You need to replace `<your MAPBOX API KEY HERE>` with a token from [Mapbox](https://www.mapbox.com/). Mapbox is free to use, and does not require any payment information.

### Note about ES6

Most of the code in this project has been written to the ES6 JavaScript specification for compatibility with modern web browsers and future-proofing JavaScript code. As much as possible, try to maintain use of ES6 in any additional JavaScript you write.
